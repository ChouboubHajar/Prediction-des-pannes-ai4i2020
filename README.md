# Failure prediction project  

## Description
This project focuses on predicting machine failures using the Ai4i2020 dataset. 
It applies machine learning techniques to analyze industrial data and forecast potential failures,
helping to improve maintenance planning and reduce downtime.

### Technologies used
Python  for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.
Machine Learning (Python)  for predictive algorithms to forecast failures.
Power BI  for data visualization of results through interactive graphs.
MySQL  for data storage.
